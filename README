em100: EM100-Pro command-line utility

This tool supports using the Dediprog EM100-Pro [1] in Linux. It supports both
the original version and the new -G2 variant.

The 'em100' device provides a way to emulate a SPI-flash chip. Various
connectors are available to allow it to take over from the in-circuit SPI chip
so that the SoC sees the em100's internal memory as the contents of the SPI
flash. Images can be loaded into the em100 over USB in a few seconds, thus
providing a much faster development cycle than is possible by reprogramming
the SPI flash each time.

Example:
  ./em100 --stop --set M25P80 -d file.bin --start -t -O 0xfff00000

Major features provided by the tool include:

- Set the chip being emulated (the tool supports about 600)
- Adjust the state of the hold pin, which supports overriding the internal SPI
- Use of several em100 devices, distinguished by their serial number
- Terminal mode, allowing the SoC to send messages
- Output a trace of SPI commands issued by the SoC
- Reading / writing em100 firmware (dangerous as it can brick your em100)

For help, use the -h option:
